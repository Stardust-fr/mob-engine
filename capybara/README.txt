Version: 2.3.2

Adds capybaras to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Capybaras spawn on dirt and grass blocks during daytime, have 8 HP and are friendly. 
They can swim, eat grass, and wander around peacefully. When killed or dying they drop 
meat which can be eaten or cooked.

Capybaras can be tamed by feeding them apples or melon slices. Feed them 5 times to 
fully tame them. Once tamed, they will follow you when you hold their favorite foods.
Feeding also restores 2 HP per item.
